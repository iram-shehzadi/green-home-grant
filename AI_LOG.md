# AI Assistance Log

Record every instance where you use AI to generate, refactor, or debug code. Four fields per entry: what you asked for, what the AI produced, what you changed, and why you changed it.

Document **3+ entries** in your AI_LOG covering **3-5 distinct patterns** from this list -- planning, multi-agent critique, plan-mode scaffolding, refactor, test generation. Aim for variety: an entry that just says "asked Claude to write X" three times doesn't demonstrate AI as a real engineering tool.

## Instance 1: Eligibility logic for married couple's allowance edge case

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Date** | YYYY-MM-DD |
| **Task** | Scaffolded eligibility check for married couple's allowance |
| **What AI Generated** | if/else chain covering 5 scenarios: single owner, joint owner, private renter, housing association renter, and council tenant. Used hardcoded age threshold of 65 for pension-credit eligibility. Did not include civil-partnership status. Error message on ineligible path was generic ("You are not eligible"). |
| **What You Changed + Why** | Removed hardcoded age threshold (was 65, should be state-pension-age variable) -- hardcoded age breaks if policy changes. Added missing civil-partnership case alongside married status -- civil partnership is a legal requirement since 2004. Changed error message from generic to specific ("You are not eligible because your household income exceeds the threshold") -- generic errors do not help users correct their input. |
